1. In the Migrate report, click **Migrate**.

### Migrate to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server using Predefined Formula

1. After clicking the Migrate button in the Solution Report, Copilot chat window will be opened with Agent Mode.
1. In Copilot chat window, click **Continue** repeatedly to confirm each tool action. The Copilot Agent uses various tools to facilitate application modernization. Each tool's usage requires confirmation by clicking the `Continue` button.
1. After each step, please manually input "Continue" to confirm and proceed.
1. Click **Continue** to confirm to run **Java Application Build-Fix** tool. This tool will attempt to resolve any build errors, in up to 10 iterations.
1. After the Build-Fix tool begins, click **Continue** to proceed and show progress and migration summary.
1. Review the proposed code changes and click **Keep** to apply them.

### Migrate to Azure Blob Storage and Azure Service Bus using Custom Formula

The Application `asset-manager` used AWS S3 for image storage and Spring AMQP with RabbitMQ for message queuing. We have already migrated the code of **Web** module to use Azure Blob Storage and Azure Service Bus. These changes are recorded in two separate commits in the `main` branch.

The following steps demonstrate how to generate custom formulas based on those existing commits. Then, you can migrate **Worker** module to use Azure Blob Storage and Azure Service Bus as well, using the created custom formulas.

1. Open the sidebar of `App Modernization for Java`. Hover the mouse over the **Formulas** section.  Select **Create formula from source control**. This icon looks like two circles with arrows pointing to the other circle. 
![Create Formula From Source Control](doc-media/create-formula-from-source-control.png)
1. Type **migrate web** to search for the commits that migrated the **Web** module, and you should see two commits listed:
   * migrate web RabbitMQ to azure service bus
   * migrate web s3 to azure blob storage
![Migration Commits](doc-media/migration-commits.png)
1. You will create two custom formulas based on the two commits. First, create the formula for migrating RabbitMQ. Select the commit of **migrate web RabbitMQ to azure service bus**, click OK.
1. Click **Create New** to create a new custom formula.
1. Default formula name will be generated. Give it a new name: "custom formula migrate RabbitMQ". Press `Enter` to confirm. Then, formula description, and search patterns will be generated in order. Press `Enter` repeatedly to confirm.
1. Now, the custom formula for migrating RabbitMQ is generated and shows in the section of formulas in of `App Modernization for Java` blade.
![Custom Formula of Migrating Rabbitmq](doc-media/custom-formula-RabbitMQ.png)
1. Create another custom formula for migrating S3. Follow the same steps you just did, select the commit **migrate web s3 to azure blob storage** to create a new custom formula with name: "custom formula migrate s3".
1. Now, the two custom formulas are ready.
![Custom Formulas](doc-media/custom-formulas.png)
1. Select and run the two custom formulas one by one you created in the formulas section of `App Modernization for Java`, one at a time.
![Run Formula](doc-media/run-formula.png)
1. Follow the same steps as the predefined formula to review and apply the changes, and run the Java Application Build-Fix tool to apply build fixes.
1. Review the proposed code changes and click **Keep** to apply them.

## Deploy to Azure

At this point, you have successfully migrated the sample Java application `asset-manager` to Migrate to Azure Database for PostgreSQL (SDK on Public Cloud), Azure Blob Storage, and Azure Service Bus. Now, you can deploy the migrated application to Azure using the Azure CLI after you identify a working location for your Azure resources.

For example, an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server requires a location that supports the service. Follow the instructions below to find a suitable location.

1. Run the following command to list all available locations for the current subscription.

   ```bash
   az account list-locations -o table
   ```

1. Select a location from column **Name** in the output.

1. Run the following command to list all available SKUs in the selected location for Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server:

   ```bash
   az postgres flexible-server list-skus --location <your location> -o table
   ```

1. If you see the output contains the SKU `Standard_B1ms` and the **Tier** is `Burstable`, you can use the location for the deployment. Otherwise, try another location.

   ```text
   SKU                Tier             VCore    Memory    Max Disk IOPS
   -----------------  ---------------  -------  --------  ---------------
   Standard_B1ms      Burstable        1        2 GiB     640e
   ```

You can either run the deployment script locally or use the GitHub Codespaces. The recommended approach is to run the deployment script in the GitHub Codespaces, as it provides a ready-to-use environment with all the necessary dependencies.

Deploy using GitHub Codespaces:
1. Commit and push the changes to your forked repository.
1. Follow instructions in [Use GitHub Codespaces for Deployment](README.md#use-github-codespaces-for-deployment) to deploy the app to Azure.

Deploy using local environment by running the deployment script in the terminal:
1. Run `az login` to sign in to Azure.
1. Run the following commands to deploy the app to Azure:

   Windows:
   ```batch
   scripts\deploy-to-azure.cmd -ResourceGroupName <your resource group name> -Location <your resource group location, e.g., eastus2> -Prefix <your unique resource prefix>
   ```

   Linux:
   ```bash
   scripts/deploy-to-azure.sh -ResourceGroupName <your resource group name> -Location <your resource group location, e.g., eastus2> -Prefix <your unique resource prefix>
   ```

Once the deployment script completes successfully, it outputs the URL of the Web application. Open the URL in a browser to verify if the application is running as expected.

## Clean up

When no longer needed,  you can delete all related resources using the following scripts.

Windows:
```batch
scripts\cleanup-azure-resources.cmd -ResourceGroupName <your resource group name>
```

Linux:
```bash
scripts/cleanup-azure-resources.sh -ResourceGroupName <your resource group name>
```

If you deploy the app using GitHub Codespaces, delete the Codespaces environment by navigating to your forked repository in GitHub and selecting **Code** > **Codespaces** > **Delete**.

1. Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces. Select the **Code** tab. Select the **Code** button, selecting **Codespaces** tab, openining the existing codespace or selecting **Create codespace** for the target branch.
1. The codespace will automatically open in the browser. Wait until it is ready.
1. Navigate to the terminal in the codespace and run `az login` to sign in to Azure. Follow the instructions to complete the sign-in process.
1. At the last step of the sign-in process, you will be asked to select a subscription and tenant. Select the appropriate subscription and tenant.
1. Run the following commands in the terminal to deploy the apps to Azure:

   ```bash
   cd asset-manager && git pull
   scripts/deploy-to-azure.sh -ResourceGroupName <your resource group name> -Location <your resource group location, e.g., eastus2> -Prefix <your unique resource prefix>
   ```

1. To clean up, run `scripts\cleanup-azure-resources.cmd -ResourceGroupName <your resource group name>` or `scripts/cleanup-azure-resources.sh -ResourceGroupName <your resource group name>` for Windows and Linux, respectively.

### Java Migration Copilot Workshop

Check out the [`main`](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-migration-copilot-samples/tree/main/asset-manager) branch for Java Migration Copilot workshop:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-migration-copilot-samples.git
cd java-migration-copilot-samples/asset-manager
git checkout main
```

Compared to the `source` branch, the `main` branch has additional commits that have already migrated the code for **Web Application** with custom code remediation, including:
* Azure Blob Storage for image storage, using managed identity authentication
* Azure Service Bus for message queuing, using managed identity authentication

The remaining targets of the workshop are:
* For both **Web Application** and **Worker Service**, migrate to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible server for metadata storage with managed identity authentication, using predefined prompt.
* For **Worker Service**, migrate to Azure Blob Storage and Azure Service Bus for image storage and message queuing, respectively, with managed identity authentication, using custom propmt created from existing commits that migrated the **Web Application**.

Once the workshop is successfully completed, you should be able to run the migrated code on Azure, similar to [Run Migrated Code on Azure](#run-migrated-code-on-azure) but using the `main` branch with the migrated code.
